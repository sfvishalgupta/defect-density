# Calculating Defect Density using Bash Script: A Step-by-Step Guide

In this article, we'll explore how to calculate defect density using a Bash script from GitHub.

## What is Defect Density?
Defect density is a metric that measures the number of defects per unit of code. It's a useful indicator of the quality and reliability of software. By calculating defect density, developers can identify areas of the codebase that require improvement.

## Why Use Bash Script?
Bash scripting is a powerful tool for automating tasks and processing data. By using a Bash script to calculate defect density, developers can streamline the process and save time.

The Bash Script
Here's an example Bash script that calculates defect density:

```
Bash
#!/bin/bash
path=$(pwd)
cd $path/$1 && git stash -u -q && git checkout $2 -q && git pull origin $2 -q 
echo $1
for week in {1..52}; do
    if [[ $week -lt $(date +%V) ]]; then
        weeknum=$((week+1))
        if [[ $week -lt 9 ]]; then
            weeknum="0$weeknum"
        fi
        sum=0
        from=$(python3 -c "import datetime;year = datetime.date.today().year;first_day = datetime.date(year, 1, 1);first_monday = first_day + datetime.timedelta(days=(7 - first_day.weekday()) % 7);start_date = first_monday + datetime.timedelta(days=($week-1)*7);print(start_date)")
        to=$(python3 -c "import datetime;year = datetime.date.today().year;first_day = datetime.date(year, 1, 1);first_monday = first_day + datetime.timedelta(days=(7 - first_day.weekday()) % 7);start_date = first_monday + datetime.timedelta(days=($week-1)*7);end_date = start_date + datetime.timedelta(days=6);print(end_date)")
        initcommit=$(cd $path/$1 && git rev-list --since="$from" --reverse $2 | head -1 )
        lastcommit=$(cd $path/$1 && git rev-list -n 1 --before="$to" $2)
        if [[ -n "$initcommit" && -n "$lastcommit" && "$initcommit" != "$lastcommit" ]]; then
            cd $path/$1 && npx cloc --git-diff-rel $initcommit $lastcommit --diff-timeout 30 --ignore-whitespace --exclude-lang JSON,Markdown --out=tmp.json --quiet --json
            if [ -f "$path/$1/tmp.json" ]; then
                sum=$((sum+ $(jq '.SUM.modified.code' $path/$1/tmp.json)))
                sum=$((sum+ $(jq '.SUM.added.code' $path/$1/tmp.json)))
                sum=$((sum+ $(jq '.SUM.removed.code' $path/$1/tmp.json)))
            fi
        fi
        echo "Week$weeknum ($from == $to) Total:- $sum"
    fi
done
```

## How the Script Works
The script works by:
1. Defining the repository path and branch_name.
2. Calculating the total number of lines of code weekly.
3. Calculating the defect density using the formula: defect density = total defects / total lines of code

## Using the Script
To use the script, simply replace the placeholders with your own values:
/path/to/your/repo: The path to your Git repository
dev: The branch from where we need line of code change.

You can then run the script using the following command:
```
Bash
REPO_PATH="repo"
BRANCH_NAME="dev"
bash init.sh "$REPO_PATH" "$BRANCH_NAME"
```
This will output the defect density for your repository.

## Conclusion
Calculating defect density is an important step in ensuring the quality and reliability of software. By using a Bash script to automate this process, developers can save time and focus on improving their codebase. With this script, you can easily calculate defect density and identify areas for improvement.
